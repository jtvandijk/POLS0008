# Examining data I

## Introduction
Welcome to your second week of **Introduction to Quantitative Research Methods**. This week we will focus on **examining data** using descriptive statistics and measures of dispersion. We will also talk about data manipulation and something called *metadata*. For the tutorial we will continue to use the `London.Pop` object that we created last week and will use this to create some plots.

### Reading list {#reading-list-w02}
For this week, you will have to read the following:

- Lane *et al.*, 2003, **Chapter 2: Graphing Distributions**. In: [Lane *et al.*, 2003, Introduction to Statistics](http://onlinestatbook.com/Online_Statistics_Education.pdf). Houston, Texas:  Rice University.

## Examining data
Any research project involving [quantitative data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research) should start with an exploration / examination of the available datasets. This applies both to data that you have collected yourself or data that you have acquired in a different way, e.g. through downloading official [UK Census and labour market statistics](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/). The set of techniques that is used to examine your data is called [descriptive statistcs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics). Descriptive statistics are used to describe the basic features of your dataset. Descriptive statistics provide simple summaries about your data. Together with simple visual analysis, they form the basis of virtually **every** quantitative analysis of data. Visualising data makes it easier to understand, analyse, and communicate.

For this tutorial we will continue to use the `London.Pop` object that we created during last week's tutorial. You may still have it loaded into your R workspace. To check if you do you can use the `ls()` command. Type this into the command line and see if `London.Pop` is printed. If not you can simply reload it:

```{r 02-make-sure-working-dir-is-set, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# set the working directory path to the folder you wish to use
# you may need to create the folder first if it doesn't exist
setwd('~/POLS0008') 
# note the single / (\\ will also work)
```

If you struggle with setting up your working directory, [have a look at how we did this last week](understanding-data.html#setting-up-the-environment#WD)!

```{r 02-load-csv, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# load csv file from working directory
London.Pop <- read.csv('census-historic-population-borough.csv')
```

```{r 02-load-csv-for-realz, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# load csv file from working directory
London.Pop <- read.csv('raw/census-historic-population-borough.csv')
```

Use the `head()`, or `View()` command to remind yourself of the structure of the London population data frame. You should see **25** columns of data.

### Plotting data in R
Tools to create high quality plots have become one of R's greatest assets. This is a relatively recent development since the software has traditionally been focused on the statistics rather than visualisation. The standard installation of R has base graphic functionality built in to produce very simple plots. For example we can plot the relationship between the London population in 1811 and 1911.

```{r 02-quick-plot, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# make a quick plot of two variables of the London population data set
plot(London.Pop$Persons.1811,London.Pop$Persons.1911)
```

#### Questions {-}
1. What happens if you change the order of the variables you put in the `plot()` function? Why?
2. Instead of using the `$` to select the columns of our dataset, how else can we get the same results?

The result of calling the `plot()` function, is a very simple [scatter graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot). The `plot()` function offers a huge number of options for customisation. You can see them using the `?plot` help pages and also the `?par` help pages (`par` in this case is short for parameters). There are some examples below (note how the parameters come after specifying the `x` and `y` columns).

```{r 02-quick-plot-with-some-options, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# add a title, change point colour, change point size
plot(London.Pop$Persons.1811, London.Pop$Persons.1911, main='Quick Plot in R', col='blue', cex=2)
```

```{r 02-quick-plot-with-different-options, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# add a title, change point colour, change point symbol
plot(London.Pop$Persons.1811, London.Pop$Persons.1911, main="Another Quick Plot in R", col='magenta', pch=22)
```

<div class="note">
For more information on the plot parameters (some have obscure names) have a look here: http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/parameters.html
</div>

### ggplot2
A slightly different method of creating plots in R requires the `ggplot2` package. There are many hundreds of packages in R each designed for a specific purpose. These are not installed automatically, so each one has to be downloaded and then we need to tell R to use it. To download and install the ggplot2 package type the following:

<div class="note">
When you hit enter R will ask you to select a [mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_site) to download the package contents from. It does not really matter which one you choose, but we would suggest you pick the mirror that is geographically closest to you.
</div>

```{r 02-install-ggplot2, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# install package
install.packages('ggplot2')
```

The `install.packages()` step only needs to be performed once. You do not need to install a the package every time you want to use it. However, each time you open R and wish to use a package you need to use the `library()` command to tell R that it will be required. 

```{r 02-load-ggplot2, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# load ggplot2 package
library(ggplot2)
```

The `ggplot2` package is an implementation of the Grammar of Graphics ([Wilkinson 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leland_Wilkinson)) - a general scheme for data visualisation that breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers. `ggplot2` can serve as a replacement for the base graphics in R and contains a number of default options that match good visualisation practice. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.

Whilst the instructions are step by step. you are encouraged to deviate from them (trying different colours for example) to get a better understanding of what we are doing. For further help, `ggplot2` is one of the best documented packages in R and [large volumes of documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) are available. Good examples of how to learn how to make great graphs and visualisations can also be found on the website https://cedricscherer.netlify.app/2019/08/05/a-ggplot2-tutorial-for-beautiful-plotting-in-r/. Let's try to make a basic plot using `ggplot2` ourselves.

```{r 02-create-that-ggplot2-object, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# create a ggplot2 object names 'p'
p <- ggplot(London.Pop, aes(Persons.1811, Persons.1911))
```

What you have just done is set up a `ggplot` object where you say where you want the input data to come from – in this case it is the `London.Pop` object. The column headings within the `aes()` brackets refer to the parts of that data frame you wish to use (the variables *Persons.1811* and *Persons.1911*). aes is short for **aesthetics that vary** – this is a complicated way of saying the data variables used in the plot. If you just type `p` and hit enter you will get an empty canvas. This is because you have not told `ggplot` what you want to do with the data. We do this by adding so-called **geoms**, in this case `geom_point()`, to create a scatter plot. Let's try this.

```{r 02-plot-that-empty-ggplot2-object}
# plot
p
```

```{r 02-add-a-geom-object, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# add our geom to our 'p' object
p <- p + geom_point()

# plot
p
```

You can already see that this plot is looking a bit nicer than the one we created with the base `plot()` function used above. Within the `geom_point()` brackets you can alter the appearance of the points in the plot. Try something like `p + geom_point(colour='red', size=2)` and also experiment with your own colours/ sizes. 

If you want to colour the points according to another variable it is possible to do this by adding the desired variable into the `aes()` section after `geom_point()`. Here we will do this to indicate the size of the population in 2011 as well as the relationship between the size of the population in 19811 and 1911.

```{r 02-add-a-geom-object-with-some-more-aes, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# add some more aesthetics that vary
p + geom_point(aes(colour = Persons.2011), size = 2)
```

You will notice that `ggplot` has also created a key that shows the values associated with each colour. In this slightly contrived example it is also possible to resize each of the points according to the `Persons.2011` variable.

```{r 02-add-a-geom-object-with-some-other-aes, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# add some more aesthetics that vary
p + geom_point(aes(size = Persons.2011))
```

The real power of `ggplot2` lies in its ability build a plot up as a series of layers. This is done by stringing plot functions (geoms) together with the `+` sign. In this case we can add a text layer to the plot using `geom_text()`.

```{r 02-full-ggplot, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# add some more aesthetics that vary
p + geom_point(aes(size = Persons.2011)) + 
    geom_text(size = 2, colour='red', aes(label = Area.Name))

```

This idea of layers (or geoms) is quite different from the standard plot functions in R, but you will find that each of the functions does a lot of clever stuff to make plotting much easier (see the `ggplot2` documentation for a full list). The above code adds London Borough labels to the plot over the points they correspond to. This isn't perfect since many of the labels overlap but they serve as a useful illustration of the layers. To make things a little easier the plot can be saved as a `PDF` using the `ggsave` command. When saving the plot can be enlarged to help make the labels more legible.

```{r 02-save-the-plot, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# save the plot
ggsave('first_ggplot.pdf', scale=2)
```

#### Questions {-}
1. Where does your plot get saved? Why?

`ggsave` only works with plots that were created with `ggplot`. Within the brackets you should create a file name for the plot - this needs to include the file format: in this case `.pdf`, but you could also save the plot as a `.jpg` file). The file will be saved to your working directory. The scale controls how many times bigger you want the exported plot to be than it currently is in the plot window. Once executed you should be able to see a PDF file in your working directory.

#### Recap {-}
In this section you have:

1. Created a scatter plot using the base plot fucntionality in R.
2. Installed and loaded additional packages in R.
3. Learned the basics of the `ggplot2` package for creating plots.
4. Learned what `geoms` are in the context of `ggplot2`.
5. Learned how to specify data variables with the `aes()` parameter.
6. Saved your plot.

In addition to plotting, descriptive statistics offer a further tool for getting to know your data. They provide useful summaries of a dataset and along with intelligent plotting can also provide a good *sanity check* to ensure the data conform to expectations.

For the rest of this tutorial we will change our dataset to one containing the number of assault incidents that ambulances have been called to in London between 2009 and 2011. You will need to download a revised version of this file called: `ambulance_assault.csv` and upload it to your working directory. It is in the same data format (`csv`) as our London population file so we use the `read.csv()` command again.

#### File download {-}
| File                                                 | Type           | Link |
| :------                                              | :------        | :------ |
| Assault Incidents London        | `csv`             | [Download](https://liveuclac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ucfajtv_ucl_ac_uk/ElYO3yqJw8RPvhwt6zOu9psBGFyesL1-aTWjralbxIGkhQ?e=m3WVg9) |

```{r 02-load-ambulance-csv, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# load csv file from working directory
input <- read.csv('ambulance_assault.csv')
```

```{r 02-load-ambulance-csv-for-realz, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# load csv file from working directory
input <- read.csv('raw/ambulance_assault.csv')
```

```{r 02-check-ambulance-csv-for-realz, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# inspect the results 
head(input)
```

```{r 02-check-nrow-ambulance-csv-for-realz, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# inspect the size of the dataset
nrow(input)
```

You will notice that the data table has 4 columns and 649 rows. The column headings are abbreviations of the following:

- **Bor_Code**: Borough Code. London has 32 Boroughs (such as Camden, Islington, Westminster, etc.) plus the City of London at the centre. These codes are used as a quick way of referring to them from official data sources. 
- **WardName**: Boroughs can be broken into much smaller areas known as [Wards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wards_and_electoral_divisions_of_the_United_Kingdom). These are electoral districts and have existed in London for centuries. 
- **WardCode**: A statistical code for the Wards above. 
- **WardType**: a classification that groups wards based on similar characteristics. 
- **assault_09_11**: The number of assault incidents requiring an ambulance between 2009 and 2011 for each Ward.

The `mean()`, `median()`, and `range()` were some of the first R functions we used at the last week to describe our `Friends` dataset. We will use these to describe our assault incident data as well as other descriptive statistics, including standard deviation. 

```{r 02-descriptive-statistics-ambulance, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# calculate the mean of the assault incident variable
mean(input$assault_09_11)

# calculate the standard deviation of the assault incident variable
sd(input$assault_09_11)

# calculate the minimum value of the assault incident variable
min(input$assault_09_11)

# calculate the maximum value of the assault incident variable
max(input$assault_09_11)

# calculate the range of the assault incident variable
range(input$assault_09_11)
```

These are commonly used descriptive statistics. To make things even easier, R has a `summary()` function that calculates a number of these routine statistics simultaneously.

```{r 02-descriptive-statistics-summary, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# calculate the most common descriptive statistics for the assault incident variable
summary(input$assault_09_11)
```

You should see you get the minimum (Min.) and maximum (Max.) values of the *assault_09_11* column; its first (1st Qu.) and third (3rd Qu.) quartiles that comprise the interquartile range; its the mean and the median. The built-in R `summary()` function does not calculate the standard deviation. There are functions in other libraries that calculate more detailed descriptive statistics, including `describe()` in the `psych` package, which we will use in the later tutorials. We can also use the `summary()` function to describe a categorical variable and it will list its levels:

```{r 02-descriptive-statistics-categorical-variable, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# summarise a categorical variable
summary(input$WardType)
```

As you may notice, the summary of a categorical variable is in very fact the same as [frequency table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_distribution):

```{r 02-frequency-table, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# create a frequency table of a categorical variable
freqtable <- table(input$WardType)

# inspect
freqtable
```

We can also get the proportion of each group using the frequency table as input:

```{r 02-prop-frequency-table, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# create a frequency table of a categorical variable
proptable <- prop.table(freqtable)

# inspect
proptable
```

## Seminar {#seminar-w02}

#### Seminar assignment {-}
Create a histogram plot of the ambulance assaults dataset:

1. Use the `ggplot2` package.
2. Instead of the `geom_point()` geom, use the `geom_histogram()` geom.
3. Figure out how to change the labels of the *x-axis* and the *y-axis*.
4. Save the plot as a `pdf`.

#### Seminar questions {-}

1. Explain why each of these statistics are useful and what type of data are required to calculate them:
- Mean
- Median
- Mode
- Interquartile Range
- Range
- Standard Deviation

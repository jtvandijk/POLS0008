Some of you, however, may wonder why taking a statistical methods course is necessary in the first place? Besides it being a requirement, there are several compelling reasons to have a (basic) knowledge of data and statistics: it will help you to understand and critically engage with academic articles; it will help you critically assess statistics used in the media, government reports, etc.; it will help you write a dissertation based on secondary analysis; it will help you write your own work convicingly. Further to this, data skills are in high demand by employers both in the public and private sectors. TL;DR: Knowing how to collect data, compile data from different sources, and analyse that data is very important. 1.1.1 Video: Overview [Lecture slides] [Watch on MS stream] 1.2 R The best way of learning about data is by working with data and getting your hands dirty. Before we will introduce some statistical methodology and talk about something called descriptive statistics, we will first have a look at one of the software tools with which we will be working this semester: R. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is extremely powerful and as such is now widely used for academic research as well as in the commercial sector. Ever wondered how those excellent graphs created by the Financial Times have been created? 1.2.1 Video: R [Lecture slides] [Watch on MS stream] Unlike software such as Excel or SPSS, the user has to type commands to get it to execute tasks such as loading in a dataset or performing a calculation. The biggest advantage of this approach is that you can build up a document, or script, that provides a record of what you have done, which in turn enables the straightforward repetition of tasks. Graphics can be easily modified and tweaked by making slight changes to the script or by scrolling through past commands and making quick edits. Unfortunately command-line computing can also be off-putting at first. It is easy to make mistakes that arenâ€™t always obvious to detect. Nevertheless, there are good reasons to stick with R. These include: Itâ€™s broadly intuitive with a strong focus on publishable-quality graphics. Itâ€™s â€˜intelligentâ€™ and offers in-built good practice â€“ it tends to stick to statistical conventions and present data in sensible ways. Itâ€™s free, cross-platform, customisable and extendable with a whole swathe of libraries (â€˜add onsâ€™) including those for discrete choice, multilevel and longitudinal regression, and mapping, spatial statistics, spatial regression, and geostatistics. It is well respected and used at the worldâ€™s largest technology companies (including Google, Microsoft and Facebook, and at hundreds of other companies. It offers a transferable skill that shows to potential employers experience both of statistics and of computing. The intention of the practical elements of this weekâ€™s content, is to provide a thorough introduction to R to get you started: The basic programming principles behind R. Loading in data from csv files and subsetting it into smaller chunks. Calculating a number of descriptive statistics for data exploration and checking. Creating basic and more complex plots in order to visualise the distributions values within a dataset. R has a steep learning curve, but the benefits of using it are well worth the effort. Take your time and think through every piece of code you type in. The best way to learn R is to take the basic code provided in tutorials and experiment with changing parameters - such as the colour of points in a graph - to really get â€˜under the hoodâ€™ of the software. Take lots of notes as you go along and if you are getting really frustrated take a break! Following a coding tutorialpic.twitter.com/dXUfp0WWv7 â€” Tawanda NyahuyeðŸ‘¨ ðŸ’» (@towernter) November 28, 2020 1.2.2 Getting started with R You can download and install R on your laptop but for the purposes of this course we would like you to use the version hosted on the UCL servers so that everyone participating in the course has access to the same version of the software. Open a web browser and navigate to: https://rstudio.rc.ucl.ac.uk/ Log in with your usual UCL username and password. You should see the RStudio interface appear. If you managed to log onto RStudio server: brilliant, we are ready to go. At its absolute simplest R is a calculator, so letâ€™s try adding some numbers by typing and hitting enter to execute the code: 4 + 10 ## [1] 14 You will notices that in the command line window, it will give you an answer directly (i.e.Â 14). These outputs of the command line window are shown as ## throughout this handbook and you do not need to type anything into the command line that follows ## (because it simply shows the result of a command!). Anything that appears as red in the command line means it is an error (or a warning) so you will likely need to correct your code. If you see a &gt; on the left it means you can type in your next line, a + means that you havenâ€™t finished the previous line of code. As will become clear, + signs often appear if you donâ€™t close brackets or you did not properly finish your command in a way that R expected. Rather than using numbers and values, it is often easier to assign numbers (or groups of them) a memorable name for easy reference later. In R terminology this is called creating an object and this is really important. Letâ€™s try this: a &lt;- 4 b &lt;- 10 The &lt;- symbol is used to assign the value to the name, in the above we assigned the integer 4 to an object with the name a. Similarly, we assigned the integer 10 to an object with the name b To see what each object contains you can just type print(name of your object), so in our case: print(a) ## [1] 4 print(b) ## [1] 10 This may look trivial, but in fact it is extremely powerful as objects can be treated in the same way as the numbers they contain. For instance: a*b ## [1] 40 Or even used to create new objects: ab &lt;- a*b print(ab) ## [1] 40 You can generate a list of objects that are currently active using the ls() command. R stores objects in your computerâ€™s RAM so they can be processed quickly. Without saving (we will come onto this below) these objects will be lost if you close R (or it crashes). ls() ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;ab&quot; &quot;b&quot; You may wish to delete an object. This can be done using rm() with the name of the object in the brackets. For example: rm(ab) To confirm that your command has worked, just run the ls() command again: ls() ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; 1.3 Statistical terminology Letâ€™s now take a short break from RStudio and have a look at some theory: the video below will introduce you to some essential statistical terminology. 1.3.1 Video: Essential Statistical Terminology [Lecture slides] [Watch on MS stream] Now we now a little more about variables, we can go back to RStudio. Until now our objects have been extremely simple integers (and you should now know what integers are!), but the real power of R comes when we can begin to execute functions on objects. Letâ€™s check this out by firstly building a more complex object through the c() function. The c in the c() function means concatenate and essentially groups things together. Letâ€™s create an object that contains the (fictional) birth years of the six main characters in the popular American television sitcom Friends. friends_dob &lt;- c(1974,1977,1977,1979,1975,1976) Letâ€™s check the results. print(friends_dob) ## [1] 1974 1977 1977 1979 1975 1976 Now, we can execute some statistical functions on this object such as cacluating the mean() value, the median() value, and the range() of the data. mean(friends_dob) ## [1] 1976.333 median(friends_dob) ## [1] 1976.5 range(friends_dob) ## [1] 1974 1979 All functions need a series of arguments to be passed to them in order to work. These arguments are typed within the brackets and typically comprise the name of the object (in the examples above its the friends_dob) that contains the data followed by some parameters. The exact parameters required are listed in the functions help files. To find the help file for the function type ? followed by the function name, for example: ?mean All helpfiles will have a usage heading detailing the parameters required. In the case of the mean you can see it simply says mean(x, ...). In function helpfiles x will always refer to the object the function requires and, in the case of the mean, the ... refers to some optional arguments that we donâ€™t need to worry about. When you are new to R the help files can seem pretty impenetrable (because they often are!). Up until relatively recently these were all people had to go on, but in recent years R has really taken off and so there are plenty of places to find help and tips. Google is best tool to use. When people are having problems they tend to post examples of their code online and then the R community will correct it. One of the best ways to solve a problem is to paste their correct code into your R command line window and then gradually change it for your data an purposes. The structure of the friends_dob object - essentially a group of numbers (integers!) - is known as a vector object in R. To build more complex objects that, for example, resemble a spreadsheet with multiple columns of data, it is possible to create a class of objects known as a data frame. This is probably the most commonly used class of object in R. We can create one here by combining two vectors. friends_characters &lt;- c(&#39;Monica&#39;,&#39;Ross&#39;,&#39;Rachel&#39;,&#39;Joey&#39;,&#39;Chandler&#39;,&#39;Phoebe&#39;) friends &lt;- data.frame(friends_characters,friends_dob) If you type print(friends) you will see our data frame. print(friends) ## friends_characters friends_dob ## 1 Monica 1974 ## 2 Ross 1977 ## 3 Rachel 1977 ## 4 Joey 1979 ## 5 Chandler 1975 ## 6 Phoebe 1976 Tips R is case sensitive so you need to make sure that you capitalise everything correctly if required. The spaces between the words donâ€™t matter but the positions of the commas and brackets do. Remember, if you find the prompt, &gt;, is replaced with a + it is because the command is incomplete. If necessary, hit the escape (esc) key and try again. It is important to come up with good names for your objects. In the case of the friends_dob object we used a underscore to separate the words. It is good practice to keep the object names as short as posssible so we could have gone for FriendsDob or f_dob. Be aware: you cannot start an object name with a number! If you press the up arrow in the command line you will be able to edit the previous lines of code you inputted. Recap Entered your first commands into the R command line interface. Created objects in R. Created a vector of values (the friends_dob object). Executed some simple R functions. Created a data frame (called friends). 1.4 Descriptive statistics 1.4.1 Video: Descriptive statistics In the previous section, R may have seemed fairly labour-intensive. We had to enter all our data manually and each line of code had to be written into the command line. Fortunately this isnâ€™t routinely the case. In RStudio look to the top left corner and you will see a plus symbol, click on it and select R Script. This should give you a blank document that looks a bit like the command line. The difference is that anything you type here can be saved as a script and re-run at a later date. When writing a script it is important to keep notes about what each step is doing. To do this the hash (#) symbol is put before any code. This comments out that particular line so that R ignores it when the script is run. Type the following into the script: # first attempt at creating a script Some.Data &lt;- data.frame(0:10,20:30) print(Some.Data) Question Without running these lines of code, what do you expect to happen? Do you understand what these simple line of codes do? In the scripting window if you highlight all the code you have written and press the Run button on the top on the scripting window you will see that the code is sent to the command line and the text on the line after the # is ignored. From now on you should type your code in the scripting window and then use the Run button to execute it. If you have an error then edit the line in the script and hit run again. Try it: # first attempt at creating a script Some.Data &lt;- data.frame(0:10,20:30) print(Some.Data) ## X0.10 X20.30 ## 1 0 20 ## 2 1 21 ## 3 2 22 ## 4 3 23 ## 5 4 24 ## 6 5 25 ## 7 6 26 ## 8 7 27 ## 9 8 28 ## 10 9 29 ## 11 10 30 The My.Data object is a data frame in need of some sensible column headings. You can add these by typing: # add column names names(Some.Data)&lt;- c(&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;) # print the object to check names were added successfully print(Some.Data) ## x y ## 1 0 20 ## 2 1 21 ## 3 2 22 ## 4 3 23 ## 5 4 24 ## 6 5 25 ## 7 6 26 ## 8 7 27 ## 9 8 28 ## 10 9 29 ## 11 10 30 Until now we have generated the data used in the examples above. One of Râ€™s great strengths is its ability to load in data from almost any file format. Comma Separated Value (csv) files are our preferred choice. These can be thought of as stripped down Excel spreadsheets. They are an extremely simple format so they are easily machine readable and can therefore be easily read in and written out of R. Since we are now reading and writing files it is good practice to tell R what your working directory is. Your working directory is the folder on the computer where you wish to store the data files you are working with. You can create a folder called POLS0008, for example. If you are using RStudio, on the lower right of the screen is a window with a Files tab. If you click on this tab you can then navigate to the folder you wish to use. You can then click on the More button and then Set as Working Directory. You should then see some code similar to the below appear in the command line. It is also possible to type the code in manually. # set the working directory path to the folder you wish to use # you may need to create the folder first if it doesn&#39;t exist setwd(&#39;~/POLS0008&#39;) # note the single / (\\\\ will also work) Once the working directory is setup it is then possible to load in a csv file. We are going to load a dataset that has been saved in the working directory we just set that shows Londonâ€™s historic population for each of its Boroughs. File download File Type Link Borough Population London csv Download Once downloaded to your own computer, this file will then need to be uploaded into RStudio. To do this click on the Upload button in the files area of the screen. Select the csv file you just downloaded and press OK. We can then type the following to locate and load in the file we need. # load csv file from working directory London.Pop &lt;- read.csv(&#39;census-historic-population-borough.csv&#39;) "]
